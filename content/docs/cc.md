# Sell Covered Calls Strategy

This strategy is very simple, and it's a good starting point for someone to begin trading options.

You probably already own some stocks, like Tesla, I don't know. It's great to own stocks, but it's not always great, because they sometimes tend to go down or trade sideways. So, we let your stocks be in the bull market, and sell some options in bear or sideways market.

## Entry

We are looking for two things, stock trend and implied volatility of your stock. We enter the covered call position if two things are true:

* Stock is trending down or sideways
* Implied Volatility is high

Let's look at these two in more detail.

### Stock Trend

Stock trend can be determined using technical indicators, or just be looking at the one year chart. One useful indicator is MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence).

Another interesting approach is to look at the price chart with IV bands. This will give you a good idea where the stock is heading vs. what people think where it's heading. If the price is consistently above the top IV bar, it means that the calls that were sold under assumption that they will expire worthless are actually get assigned. This is not what we want. We want to sell a call and we want it to actually expire worthless. So, we want the price to wobble between IV bands, or to be close to the lower band.
